## To do

### Last checked: May 9, 2022

#### Done

* change date formatting so Excel doesn’t convert weeks (force as characters) – uses YearWeek instead of just Week
* output a table of || TP2 cluster | Pango lineage | Size ||
    * check this is easy to extract for user
* want to minimize user text entry
* should be able to get top 10 clusters by size and by rate (ones with fastest growth rate)
* clustering before the heatmap 
    * should be clearly clustered
* pull out the heatmap color palette (should be user-adjustable)
* cluster by (geo, temp, temp-geo) – user choice
* the whisker plot run out of memory if running all top 20 clusters when there are two cluster sizes bigger than 9000 (comment out)
* heatmaps – original cluster name 
* heatmap adjustment – for largest growth clusters (what is minimum size to consider? note: min value of 2, will not consider singletons)
* weekly ECC not consistent with monthly ECC at turn of year
    * new report missing the first week of 2021, use YearWeek instead of Week
* transform in heatmap section should be off as default
    * add as option in form_inputs
* novel_only ECC columns not found
* add options for YearWeek labeling (years x, y, where x is the year before y) in the case of overlapping between last week of x and first week of y - suppose last week of x is week x-52: 
    * first week of y is labeled x-52
    * first week of y is labeled y-01
* paired histograms – should be able to shade these
    * see scripts/Misc/plotting_functions.R and the frequencyPlots() function for how it's plotted
* documents describing the analysis – figure out which components need this (of my part)

#### Not done

* better average_dists implementation (faster, for larger files)
* go through GZ’s report – see which parts can be generated by pre-processing scripts, do so
    * first make sure you have the updated version
* whisker plots – too much data?
* top growth clusters not the same as GZ’s results
    * potentially fixed? double-check
* line 919 – pairwise geo and temp distance for top 20 clusters need to calculate the actual physical pairwise distance, then we have to change the distance calculation in step 4
* modular heatmaps – big task
    * should make the heatmap generation as independent of the CGM-ECC-metrics generation as possible
* heatmap generation - write up in a jupyter notebook / Rmarkdown file - so it's easy for others to verify steps
    * partially done
* make sure the notes for clusters with figures are clear
